Introduction:
The aim of this project is to compare various alogorithms performance with different input data size.The language to produce this task I have used is Angular.Angular uses the Javascript property on client side location which is typescript. It is facst in performance. The UI is also attractive.

Steps to run the code:
1. The user should navigate to the folder where the code is present.In this case navigate to the folder 'project1code'.
2. Then open the command prompt on the same path then type commmand 'ng serve --open' this will open in the default browser.User can also type 'ng serve' and then type 'localhost:4200' in the browser to run the code.

Steps for the application:
1. The user will be shown on the default page where the user will see the option to enter the enter the input array.
2. The user then have to select the algorithm to calculate the performance.The time will be displayed in seconds.
3. The user will also have an option to test on large input array.User should then select the algorithm and click on calculate to see the perfromance.
4. The performance will be showed in seconds and the sorted input array of less than 30 will be shown. Greater than that wont be able to show on screen.If the array is empty the calculation will 0.
5. The user can also click on the visualize to see the comparison of the performance.The table will display the performance overall.The user has option to see the graph for small, large and average dataset indivudually or collectively.
